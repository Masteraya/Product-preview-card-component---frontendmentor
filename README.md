# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

First attempt at a frontendmentor project
Additionally getting familiar with uploading code to Github

In this project a sample product preview card was copied
I tried using variables for colors, fonts, etc. and attempted to not use "px" as a unit too much

Any tips for streamlining and best practices are highly appreciated

### What I learned

This project was mostly a review of things I already knew, however I learned how to use 2 different pictures in a media querry by setting the display of one picture to hidden and then swapping the displays around in the media querry.
