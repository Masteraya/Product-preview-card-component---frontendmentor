# Product-preview-card-component---frontendmentor
Product preview card component from frontendmentor

First attempt at a frontendmentor project
Additionally getting familiar with uploading code to Github

In this project a sample product preview card was copied
I tried using variables for colors, fonts, etc. and attempted to not use "px" as a unit too much

Any tips for streamlining and best practices are highly appreciated
